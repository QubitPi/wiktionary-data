[wiktionary-data]() is a sub-data extraction of the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) that currently
supports the following languages:

- German
- Latin
- Ancient Greek
- Old Persian

[wiktionary-data]() was originally a sub-module of [wilhelm-graphdb](https://github.com/QubitPi/wilhelm-graphdb). While
the dataset it's getting bigger, I noticed a wave of more exciting potentials this dataset can bring about that
stretches beyond the scope of the containing project. Therefore I decided to promote it to a dedicated module; and here
comes this repo.

The Wiktionary language data is available on ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face Datasets][Hugging Face dataset URL].

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("QubitPi/wiktionary-data", split="German")
```

The available splits are

- `German`
- `Latin`
- `AncientGreek`
- `OldPersian`

In addition, a separate split for graph data is offered:

- `GraphData`

This split contains all the languages and puts everything in a giant graph

Development
-----------

Although [the original Wiktionary dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) is available, parsing it from scratch involves
rather complicated process. We would probably do it in the future. At present, however, we would simply take the awesome
works by [tatuylonen](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract) which has already processed it and presented it in
[in JSON format](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/rawdata.html). wiktionary-data takes the
__raw Wiktextract data (JSONL, one object per line)__ option.
